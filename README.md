## 📂 Key Directories

1. **📁 Projects**: Contains small projects I've built while learning C, such as a simple game and a "Hello, World!" program.
2. **📁 Samples**: A collection of basic C programs to practice fundamental concepts like input/output, arithmetic operations, and control flow.
   - **📁 1_basic_programs**: Includes programs like:
     - `📄 hello_world.c`: A simple "Hello, World!" program.
     - `📄 add_two_num.c`: Adds two numbers and displays the result.
     - `📄 swap_two_numbers.c`: Swaps two numbers.
     - `📄 even_or_odd.c`: Checks if a number is even or odd.
     - More to come! 🚧
