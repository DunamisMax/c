# hello world

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Print "Hello, World!" to the console
    printf("Hello, World!\n");

    // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Program Purpose**: This is a simple C program that prints the message `"Hello, World!"` to the console. It is often the first program written by beginners learning a new programming language.
2. **Output**: The program uses the `printf` function from the `stdio.h` library to display the text `"Hello, World!"` followed by a newline character (`\n`) to move the cursor to the next line.
3. **Return Value**: The `main` function returns `0` to indicate that the program executed successfully.

### Example Run

```bash
Hello, World!
```
